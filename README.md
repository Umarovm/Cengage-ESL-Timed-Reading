# Cengage ESL Timed Reading
This source code was leaked by the exploitation of a [directory traversal vulnerability](https://college.cengage.com/cgi-bin/esl_site/timed_reading/timed_reading.cgi?unit01/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd) (CWE-23).

This was developed by Duncan B. Sutherland III in February 2002.

The HTML and JS files are not included because they can just be viewed through "view-source:". These are just the files for the server-sided source code and the files that are generally not visible to the user.
